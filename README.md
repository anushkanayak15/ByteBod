Firebase is our selected backend and datastore for its organized structure in managing user information. It provides authentication, diverse APIs (authentication, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Storage), all activated by client-side SDKs. We opted for Firebase as our datastore due to its built-in functions streamlining database processesâ€”creation, reading, and writing. On the frontend, we employed JavaScript/HTML and CSS.
